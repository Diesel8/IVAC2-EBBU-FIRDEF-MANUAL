Presets are used to define a set of maps which can be linked to an ATC station. These are often linked to a specific ATC Station which can be selected in the  IVAC2 Launcher .  Presets can also be used to change maps for a certain purpose. In EBBU you can for instance control  Extended Centerline , you can activate  ALL  easterly Extended Centerlines or  ALL  westerly Extended Centerlines.  We will go more in depth in what each preset does in the  Presets List  page",
